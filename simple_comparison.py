print("ARCHITECTURE COMPARISON: COMPLEX vs SIMPLE")
print("=" * 60)

print("\n[CURRENT] COMPLEX ARCHITECTURE")
print("- app.py (748 lines): Complex routing and state management")
print("- ai_service.py (423 lines): Complex AI service with JSON parsing") 
print("- question_tracker.py (200+ lines): AI-driven question tracking")
print("- topic_tracker.py: Legacy topic tracking system")
print("- chat_ui.py (308 lines): Complex UI with multiple message types")
print("- system_prompt.txt (750+ lines): Massive prompt with complex instructions")
print("- Plus: session.py, summary.py, export.py, config.py, etc.")
print("\nEstimated Total: ~2,500 lines of code")

print("\nProblems:")
print("- Multiple overlapping tracking systems causing conflicts")
print("- Complex state management across many files")
print("- Brittle - small changes break multiple components") 
print("- Hard to debug due to complex abstractions")
print("- Frequent production errors and crashes")

print("\n[PROPOSED] SIMPLE ARCHITECTURE")
print("- simple_app.py (~200 lines): Single file with everything needed")
print("- questions.json (optional ~50 lines): Simple question list")
print("- Basic styling (optional ~30 lines)")
print("\nEstimated Total: ~280 lines of code")
print("REDUCTION: ~90% fewer lines!")

print("\nBenefits:")  
print("- Single file - easy to understand and modify")
print("- Simple state management - just a dictionary")
print("- Direct AI conversation - no complex parsing needed")
print("- Easy to debug - linear flow")
print("- Fast development - changes take minutes, not hours")
print("- Reliable - fewer moving parts mean fewer failures")

print("\nUSER EXPERIENCE COMPARISON")
print("=" * 40)

print("\n[CURRENT] Complex Version Issues:")
print("- Sometimes crashes with KeyError")
print("- JSON blocks occasionally show in responses")
print("- AI asks 'Who?' then 'Why?' separately") 
print("- Progress tracking doesn't work reliably")
print("- Complex behavior that's hard to predict")

print("\n[PROPOSED] Simple Version Benefits:")
print("- Reliable - no crashes or complex state issues")
print("- Clean responses - just natural conversation")
print("- Proper question format - combined questions as intended") 
print("- Simple, clear progress bar that always works")
print("- Predictable behavior users can trust")
print("- Focus on making the conversation engaging and helpful")

print("\nDEVELOPMENT COMPARISON")
print("=" * 40)

print("\n[CURRENT] Development Pain:")
print("- Need to understand 8+ interconnected files")
print("- Changes require touching multiple components")
print("- Complex debugging across multiple abstractions")
print("- Adding features is time-consuming and error-prone")

print("\n[PROPOSED] Development Joy:")
print("- Understand one main file - that's it")
print("- Changes are localized and obvious")
print("- Easy debugging - linear flow to follow")
print("- Adding features is quick and safe")

print("\nMIGRATION PLAN")
print("=" * 40)
print("\nDay 1: Create Simple Version")
print("  [DONE] Created simple_app.py with core functionality")
print("  [TODO] Add remaining ACE questions to the list")
print("  [TODO] Polish AI prompting for better conversations")
print("  [TODO] Add basic styling for visual appeal")

print("\nDay 2: Polish Experience") 
print("  [TODO] Make AI more engaging and conversational")
print("  [TODO] Add smooth animations and visual feedback")
print("  [TODO] Improve progress display")
print("  [TODO] Add example responses for each question")

print("\nDay 3: Deploy and Validate")
print("  [TODO] Deploy simple version")
print("  [TODO] A/B test with users")
print("  [TODO] Gather feedback and tweak")
print("  [TODO] Full migration once validated")

print("\n" + "=" * 60)
print("RECOMMENDATION: Go with the simple architecture!")
print("- 90% less code to maintain")
print("- Much more reliable user experience")
print("- Faster development and easier debugging")
print("- Still innovative and engaging for users")
print("- Can always add complexity later if truly needed")
