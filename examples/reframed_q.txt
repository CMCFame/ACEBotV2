## Reframed ACE Questionnaire for ARCOS Implementation

### Chatbot Introduction:

> "Hi! I'm ACE, your assistant for configuring ARCOS. To ensure the system perfectly fits your needs, I'll guide you through a series of questions about your callout processes. This should take about 15-20 minutes. Let's get started!"

---

### **Section 1: Basic Callout Information**

The goal of this section is to understand the general context of the situation that requires mobilizing personnel.

1.  **To begin, could you please provide your name and your company's name?**
    * *Note: This question is already in your code and is an excellent starting point.*
2.  **Describe the type of situation or event that triggers this callout process.**
    * *User Guidance:* "For example: Is it for a power outage, a gas leak, a request from a dispatcher, or unplanned maintenance?"
3.  **How many employees, and with which roles or job classifications, are typically required for this type of event?**
    * *User Guidance:* "For example: 'We need 2 linemen and 1 supervisor' or 'One qualified dispatcher is required'."

### **Section 2: Initial Contact Process**

Now, let's detail who is contacted first and how, which is fundamental for the ARCOS logic.

4.  **Who is contacted first, and what is the main reason for that person or role being the first?**
    * *Note:* Combining "Who?" and "Why?" into a single question encourages a more comprehensive answer. The reason is key, whether it's due to a union agreement, being "Next Up" on a list, or their specific role.
5.  **Thinking of the first person to be contacted, how many devices are used to try and reach them (e.g., work phone, personal cell)?**
    * *User Guidance:* "For example: One (primary) or two (primary and secondary)."
6.  **Are those devices contacted one by one in a specific order, or all at the same time? If in order, what is it and why is it done that way?**
    * *Note:* This question is clearer than the original. The justification is important, such as "both at the same time to get a faster response."
7.  **What types of devices are primarily used? (e.g., cell phones, landlines, radios, etc.)**

### **Section 3: Callout List Management**

This is the most critical part for the ARCOS configuration. These questions aim to understand the structure, order, and logic of your lists.

8.  **After the first employee, is the next person called from the same list or a different one?**
9.  **In total, how many different lists or groups are used to fully staff this callout?**
    * *User Guidance:* "Sometimes, in addition to the main list, there are backup or emergency lists."
10. **Are the lists organized by job classification (e.g., 'Linemen,' 'Supervisors')? If not, what other attribute determines the order (e.g., overtime hours, seniority, special qualifications)?**
11. **When going through a list, do you follow a strict top-to-bottom order, or are people ever skipped?**
    * *User Guidance:* "For example, do you call strictly according to the 'Next Up' order, or do you bypass employees for any reason?"
12. **If employees are skipped, what are the reasons? (e.g., based on qualifications, status like vacation/sick, etc.)**
13. **Are there any planned pauses between call attempts within the same list?**

---

### **Section 4: Handling Insufficient Staffing**

Here we explore contingency plans, which are critical business rules for ARCOS.

14. **If you don't get the required number of people from the primary list, what is the next step?**
    * *User Guidance:* "For example: Do you call a different list, personnel from another location, or notify a supervisor?"
15. **Is the primary list called a second time before moving on to other options?**
16. **In critical situations, is the position ever offered to employees who would not normally be called?**
17. **Is this procedure for when staffing is insufficient always the same, or does it vary depending on the situation (e.g., major emergency vs. routine)?**

---

### **Section 5: Additional Rules and Logistics**

These fine details are what make the configuration robust and 100% adapted to your operations.

18. **Is it possible for an employee to decline the callout but ask to be contacted again if no one else accepts? How is that situation managed?**
19. **If an employee says no on the first pass through the list, are they contacted again on a second pass?**
20. **Does the order or content of the lists ever change over time? If so, how often and what triggers it (e.g., new hires, changes in qualifications, balancing of overtime)?**
21. **If the list order is based on overtime, what criteria are used as a tie-breaker if two employees have the same hours (e.g., seniority, hire date)?**
22. **Besides calls, are other methods like emails or text messages used to provide information about the callout?**
23. **Are there any rules that prevent calling someone right before or after their normal shift?**
24. **Finally, are there any rules that would excuse an employee for declining a callout without it counting against them (e.g., if it's near their vacation, a scheduled shift, etc.)?**
