Hi Victor! I'm ACE, your questionnaire assistant. I see you work for a utility organization. Let's start documenting your callout process with our streamlined 23-question format.

Describe the type of situation or event that triggers this callout process.

ðŸ‘¤
We use this callout process for power outages affecting 500 or more customers, typically caused by storms, equipment failures, or vehicle accidents that damage our infrastructure.

ðŸ¤–
Got it!

How do you initially become aware of these situations?

ðŸ‘¤
example

ðŸ¤–
Here's an example of how a utility might become aware of these situations:

We typically become aware through our outage management system, which alerts us when a certain number of customers lose power. We also receive calls from customers reporting outages.

Now, could you please tell me:

How many employees, and with which roles or job classifications, are typically required for this type of event?

ðŸ‘¤
example

ðŸ¤–
Here's an example response:

For a typical outage, we usually require 3-5 employees. This typically includes a dispatcher, 1-2 lineworkers, and possibly a supervisor depending on the severity of the outage.

Who is contacted first, and what is the main reason for that person or role being the first?

ðŸ‘¤
example

ðŸ¤–
Here's an example response:

The dispatcher is contacted first because they're responsible for assessing the situation and coordinating the response team.

Thinking of the first person to be contacted, how many devices are used to try and reach them (e.g., work phone, personal cell)?

ðŸ‘¤
example

ðŸ¤–
Here's an example response:

We typically use 3 devices to reach the dispatcher: their work desk phone, work cell phone, and personal cell phone as a backup.

Are those devices contacted one by one in a specific order, or all at the same time? If in order, what is it and why is it done that way?

ðŸ‘¤
example

ðŸ¤–
Here's an example response:

We contact devices one by one in this order: work desk phone, work cell, then personal cell. This order minimizes disruption to personal life while ensuring we reach them promptly.

How long does the system wait for a response before moving to the next person on the list?

ðŸ‘¤
example

ðŸ¤–
Here's an example response:

Our system waits 5 minutes for a response before moving to the next person. This allows enough time for someone to notice and respond, but isn't so long that it delays our emergency response significantly.

Does the system allow for customization of wait times based on factors like time of day or urgency of the call?

ðŸ‘¤
example

ðŸ¤–
Here's an example response:

Yes, our system allows for customization. We have shorter wait times (3 minutes) during peak hours and for high-priority calls, while non-urgent calls during off-hours have longer wait times (10 minutes).

How does the system determine the urgency or priority of a call?

ðŸ‘¤
example

ðŸ¤–
Here's an example response:

The system uses predefined criteria to assess urgency. Factors include the nature of the reported issue (e.g., power outage vs. billing inquiry), number of affected customers, and potential safety risks.

If employees are skipped, what are the reasons? (e.g., based on qualifications, status like vacation/sick, etc.)

ðŸ‘¤
example

ðŸ¤–
Here's an example response:

Employees might be skipped if they're on vacation, sick leave, or already working another shift. We also consider qualifications - for instance, only certified linemen are called for certain electrical issues.

If you don't get the required number of people from the primary list, what is the next step?

ðŸ‘¤
example

ðŸ¤–
Here's an example response:

If we don't get enough people from the primary list, we move to a secondary list of employees who have indicated availability for overtime or extra shifts. If that's not sufficient, we may contact supervisors or managers to help fill the remaining positions.

In critical situations, is the position ever offered to employees who would not normally be called?

ðŸ‘¤
example

ðŸ¤–
Here's an example response:

During major storms, we'll contact recently retired employees who still maintain their certifications and are willing to help during emergencies. They know our systems and can be very valuable.

Is this procedure for when staffing is insufficient always the same, or does it vary depending on the situation (e.g., major emergency vs. routine)?

ðŸ‘¤
example

ðŸ¤–
Here's an example response:

The procedure can vary. For routine situations, we follow the standard 15-minute rule. However, for major emergencies, we might shorten the response time to 5 minutes and simultaneously contact multiple employees to ensure faster staffing.

How does the system determine which employees to contact first for a callout?

ðŸ‘¤
example

ðŸ¤–
Here's an example response:

Our system uses a combination of factors to prioritize employees for callouts. It considers their skills, availability, proximity to the work site, and overtime hours. For instance, a nearby employee with the right skill set and fewer overtime hours might be contacted first.

If an employee says no on the first pass through the list, are they contacted again on a second pass?

ðŸ‘¤
yes

ðŸ¤–
Thanks!

How many passes through the list does the system typically make before escalating or giving up?

ðŸ‘¤
2

ðŸ¤–
Understood.

What happens if no one accepts the callout after these passes through the list?

ðŸ‘¤
we go through the list again

ðŸ¤–
Alright.

Is there a limit to how many times you'll go through the list before taking other actions?

ðŸ‘¤
example

ðŸ¤–
Here's an example:

We might go through the callout list 3 times. If no one accepts after the third pass, we escalate to a supervisor who may use alternative methods to find someone or make a decision on how to proceed.

Are there any specific incentives offered to encourage acceptance of callouts?

ðŸ‘¤
example

ðŸ¤–
Sure, here's an example:

We offer a few incentives for callout acceptance. Employees who respond to callouts receive overtime pay at 1.5x their regular rate. Additionally, we have a points system where accepting callouts earns rewards like extra vacation days or gift cards. This helps motivate staff to be available for emergency situations.

Are there any specific qualifications or certifications required for employees to be eligible for callouts?

ðŸ‘¤
example

ðŸ¤–
Sure, here's an example:

Yes, for certain types of callouts, we require specific certifications. For example, linemen need to have their Journeyman Lineman certification to respond to electrical emergencies. For gas leaks, we require Gas Emergency Response certification. Some specialized equipment also requires specific training or licenses to operate during callouts.

How do you track and manage these certifications to ensure only qualified personnel are called for specific types of emergencies?

ðŸ‘¤
example

ðŸ¤–
Certainly! Here's an example:

We use a centralized database that tracks all employee certifications and their expiration dates. This database is integrated with our callout system. When a specific type of emergency occurs, the system automatically filters the callout list to only include employees with the required certifications. We also send automated reminders to employees and their supervisors when certifications are nearing expiration.
