    3: "Usually 3-4 lineworkers and 1 supervisor for main breaks, up to 15-20 people for major storms",
    4: "We call the on-call dispatcher first because they coordinate all emergency response and know current crew availability",
    5: "Each employee has 2 devices - a work cell phone and personal cell phone",
    6: "We call the work cell first because it's company-issued and employees are required to answer during their on-call rotation",
    7: "Cell phones primarily, some older employees still have landlines as backup",
    8: "Same list - we work down our main callout list in order of overtime hours",
    9: "We use 3 main lists: lineworkers, supervisors, and contractors. Plus a backup list from neighboring districts",
    10: "Lists are organized by job classification first, then by overtime hours within each classification",
    11: "We call straight down the list in order, no skipping unless someone is on vacation or sick leave",
    12: "Yes, we skip people who are on approved vacation, medical leave, or already working another callout",
    13: "We pause for 2 minutes between calls to give people time to answer, longer pauses during overnight hours",
    14: "We move to our backup list from neighboring districts, then call contractors if still short-staffed",
    15: "Yes, we call the backup district list with about a 10-minute delay while we coordinate with dispatch",
    16: "As a last resort, we'll call people who recently declined if it's a major emergency",
    17: "For major storms we'll call the whole list again, but for routine calls we stop after one pass",
    18: "Storm procedures are different - we're more aggressive and call everyone multiple times",
    19: "No issues calling multiple employees at once, we have an automated system that can dial 10 numbers simultaneously",
    20: "We can call multiple devices for the same person, but usually only if they don't answer the first device",
    21: "Yes, they can say 'call me back if nobody else takes it' and we mark them as secondary availability",
    22: "People who said no on first pass get called again only for major emergencies or if we're really short",
    23: "List order changes monthly based on overtime hours - lowest overtime hours go to top of list",
    24: "Every month after payroll runs, we resort by overtime hours. Also changes when new hires come on",
    25: "Yes, people get added when hired, removed when they quit, moved between classifications with promotions",
    26: "HR updates the lists with new hires, terminations, and job changes. We update for medical leave status",
    27: "First tiebreaker is seniority, second is alphabetical order, third is distance from work location",
    28: "Seniority - whoever has been with the company longer gets called first",
    29: "If seniority is tied, we go alphabetical by last name",
    30: "If both seniority and names are close, we call whoever lives closer to the work site",
    31: "We text initial alerts to everyone on the list before starting calls, gives them a heads up",
    32: "We don't call anyone between 10 PM and 6 AM unless it's a true emergency affecting customers",
    33: "People on vacation are automatically excused. We excuse declined callouts if they're starting a shift within 4 hours"
